    <h1>Personal</h1>
    <p>From USA, have lived in the UK for 10 years now.</p>
    <p>Live in Bristol with my husband, son, and 2 cats.</p>
    <p>
      Have an allotment, which I'm totally obsessed about. Really enjoy the
      challenge of using design thinking to make it efficient and easy to manage
      alongside the 9-5. My next goal on the plot is to build a tunnel of
      climbing squash, pumpkins, and legumes, and to grow edible flowers to bake
      and craft with. I would LOVE to keep chickens down the line. There's
      always more to do!
    </p>
    <p>
      I also play board games, make candles, and do various crafts (total
      amateur but fun!). Crafts include watercolour painting, drawing, knitting,
      sewing, collaging, and lino. I enjoy going to the theatre, gigs, and
      general culture-vulturing whenever possible. Some of my faves are:

      Other hobbies that I cycle through depending on my mood include running,
      walking, reading, Irish Dance, Swing Dance, and standup paddleboarding.
      I've also done improv classes in the past which I really enjoyed. Travel -
      especially around the UK - is fun when life allows.
