        I have worked with Robyn for two weeks on the Ministry of Defence IDV
        project and I am seriously impressed by her work ethic. Robyn delivers
        like a senior consultant. We were given an idea with very little context
        and she has demonstrated amazing abilities as a self-starter. Robyn
        proactively asks questions to understand the domain, identifies risks,
        and shares findings to the rest of the team. Really great job!

        I really enjoyed working with you on this piece of work. I was genuinely
        impressed by your facilitation skills, you are a natural. You managed to
        balance multiple things efficiently - listening, designing, taking notes
        and guiding conversations. It’s a real strength, and it made a big
        difference to how smoothly the sessions ran.
      </p>

      <p>
        I dont have any recommendations for improvement at this stage, as the
        project and scope were quite simple and short. That said, you
        demonstrated a very pragmatic approach, which was great to see.

        Having someone join a project with such enthusiasm and positivity is
        always a pleasure, and your contributions have made an impact. You
        quickly got to grips with a complex ecosystem under tight deadlines and
        consistently delivered high-quality work that not only impressed the
        client but also reflected brilliantly on Hippo. </p>
        
        <p>You're incredibly easy to work with, and your proactive, can-do attitude made a real impact.
        I’d absolutely love to have you on the team for a longer stretch if the
        opportunity arises, but regardless, I truly hope we get to work together
        again in the future.</p>
        
        <p>Your enthusiasm is contagious, and your commitment
        to delivering the best for the client really shows in your eagerness to
        explore and develop new skills and techniques. Thank you for your
        brilliant work!</p>

        Firstly, I think we’ve done brilliantly to turn this project around in
        less than a working week! I’ve also really appreciated how you’ve
        actively sought feedback in a timely manner. </p>
        
        <p>Your ability to create clear, user-focused designs made the process seamless. You successfully
        met the needs of the client, collaborated effectively with the content
        designs and produced visually engaging infographics by the end of the
        week. In the initial call with the client, you asked all the right
        questions, like 'Where will this be shown?', 'What do you want to
        communicate in this space?', 'How do we create buy-in for stakeholders?'</p>

        <p>Your collaborative approach made it a real pleasure to work alongside
        you and communication was easy throughout. I suspect this isn’t just
        because of the strict deadline either— I imagine this is what it's like
        to work with you on a bigger project!</p>
        <p>Additionally, you’ve done a great
        job protecting your time and ensuring internal Wiki work didn’t
        interfere with delivering this project. You have set excellent
        boundaries, even under tight deadlines. Thanks as well for taking notes
        while I was driving the screen on Thursday. It allowed me to focus on
        explaining the rationale to the stakeholder, rather than trying to
        juggle both tasks.</p>
        <p>As we’ve only worked together briefly, it’s difficult for me to suggest an area for improvement. From what I've seen so far,
        you've been excellent!</p>

        From the outset, Robyn's friendly and approachable demeanour made it
        easy for me to feel comfortable collaborating with her. Her
        professionalism and eagerness to not only improve the system for our
        users but also make developers’ lives easier stood out throughout my
        time working with her. Despite the tight timeframe, she prioritized
        ensuring we had a well-mapped journey, which was invaluable in
        supporting our development process. In meetings, she had an amazing
        ability to calmly present ideas and keep everyone focused when
        conversations veered off track, an especially important skill given our
        deadlines. On top of this, she was consistently quick to respond to any
        questions I had, which made working with her more seamless and
        enjoyable. </p>
        
        <p>It's been a pleasure to work alongside someone with her level
        of dedication, thoughtfulness, and skill! I wish her all the best on her
        upcoming projects and any client would be lucky to have Robyn working
        for them!</p>

        I wanted to share my feedback on working closely with Robyn over the
        past five weeks on the Manage My Construction Project at the Department
        for Education.</p>
        <p>Robyn consistently brought a thoughtful, big picture
        perspective to discussions and was excellent at asking the right
        questions to challenge assumptions when needed. Her focus on aligning
        the team with broader project goals, especially in a constantly shifting
        environment, was invaluable.</p>
        <p>I particularly admired her willingness to
        dive deep into complex areas, ensuring full understanding for herself
        and the team. Her attention to detail and clear, forward-thinking
        approach helped keep us on track and ensured we always considered how
        the work being done by the various project sub-streams would fit
        together further down the line.</p>
        <p>Robyn was a pleasure to work with. She
        was approachable, professional, and contributed greatly to the
        collaborative team dynamic. Her communication skills, especially on
        challenging topics, were a key asset. I'd be delighted to work with
        Robyn again on future projects.</p>

        Robyn has been an absolute dream to work with - I'm so happy that she
        has joined Hippo. She jumped into the TISA project sight unseen and gave
        her absolute all.   
      </p>
      <p> From the get go she came in with a smile and a positive attitude that made it so easy for me to explain a project with
        some challenging stakeholders. Not only did Robyn do everything asked of
        her but she went above and beyond to improve processes and assets to
        make it more efficient and easier for others to do a good job too.</p>
        <p>On a project with such a quick turnaround it was particularly helpful that
        Robyn took notes on most (if not all) 12 user research sessions and
        created note-taking templates for other colleagues to use as well, which
        made the note-taking much more straight forward. She even duplicated and
        labelled tabs in a spreadsheet for other people so that all we had to do
        was log in and type up our notes. It didn't just feel like an excellent
        work ethic and efficiency but kindness and respect too - which I really
        appreciated.</p>
        <p>She was always on hand and super reliable and continued to
        offer her support into the report-writing and made really useful
        contributions to the retro as well. All of this to say, her actual notes
        were also excellent and incredibly useful to me as I only had 1 day for
        analysis.</p>
        <p>I'm really excited for Robyn given that she's done all of this
        and has barely been with Hippo for a fortnight! Like I said, she's been
        an absolute dream and I'd love to work with her again.</p>

    <p>I can’t say emphatically enough how much I enjoyed working with Robyn in
        Apprenticeship Services. I am constantly astounded by her abilities and
        genuinely look forward to every meeting I have with her.</p>
    <p>For context, I
        joined her delivery team at the end of a discovery. Robyn had been a
        significant driving force in the initial phases, navigating the pressure
        with apparent ease. She had analyzed an immense amount of secondary
        research, talked with an enormous number of stakeholders, and
        essentially crafted the team’s entire strategy going forward as a
        result. She’d played back all these results in beautiful, well-presented
        decks and involved the team in great ideation sessions. When I joined,
        she onboarded me to the project in an incredibly useful and clear way.</p>
    <p>During our work together, the things that impressed me the most about
        Robyn included her intelligence, speed, confidence, and expertise. She's
        easily the best user researcher I've met - it truly feels like a joy to
        her and not a tick box exercise and it shows. She's also fantastic and
        so multi-talented - she leapt in and out of design work to make the UR
        really come to life and suggested brilliant ideas - it felt like UR was
        finally a core part of our UCD team, not a standalone unit, which was
        great.</p>
    <p>One of the things that set Robyn aside is the way she processes
        knowledge with such speed. It's difficult to explain in words as it's
        more something you sense when you meet someone - but for one example,
        during research sessions she will put people at ease instantly,
        note-take in detail, shape the conversation in a way that feels fluid
        and like a real discussion, and end with what feels like almost
        simultaneous synthesis afterward, already shaping up how she'll tweak
        the discussion next time and responding fluidly to any deviations or
        side discussions. She has a script but doesn't stick rigidly to it and
        she responds empathetically to participants. All of this means her work
        is responsive and adaptable at a split seconds notice.</p>
    <p>Whenever the team
        has asked her for something she's also been incredibly speedy and
        detailed in her response. Robyn was frequently called upon to
        effectively lead the team, making decisions or running activities
        normally beyond the scope of her role. In every instance, she met the
        challenge to help the team out, while gracefully and confidently
        highlighting her expectations of how the role should work together. In
        this way, she helped others understand their roles better too.</p>
    <p>TLDR -
        Working with Robyn has been one of the best professional experiences
        I've had and I hope our paths cross again one day!</p>

        The ideation session was so much fun and I found it super useful to get
        to talk about all of our ideas and approach together. I’ve never had a

        I think the way you've approached this problem is brilliant. This is
        such a messy and complicated problem space, I was really worried that it
        would get mishandled, but you're asking all the right questions. Your
        approach is just so logical and airtight you actually can't argue with
        it, and it's great to see the service finally reconsidering its
        relationship with employers and providers now because of that. I'm
        really impressed, really well done

        Robyn was a great member of our project team. Especially in the early
        days of the project, she really helped us to define what we were looking
        to achieve. She advocated for our users all the time, and was confident
        challenging us when we needed to be challenged! Her positivity and
        enthusiasm was a huge contribution to the team. I was often amazed by
        her efficiency and how much she got done well and quickly. She was
        responsive to change along the way, including at short notice. I
        thoroughly enjoyed working with her and would be delighted to work with
        her again.

        Robyn had a really positive attitude and wasn’t afraid to ask questions
        and challenge decisions when needed. Her work on the wireframes was
        great too - she has a great intuition for creating them and took care to
        really think through the requirements and ensure that our previous work
        fed into her decisions. She was great in our usability testing sessions
        as well; she has a nice manner with participants and got a good level of
        information and detail as required. She was able to work through
        technical challenges without getting phased and her calm approach kept
        things balanced throughout the project.

        Robyn was a fantastic welcome to Nomensa for me. My first task was
        translating Robyn’s fantastic research into development tasks. She was
        an amazing teammate - so welcoming, lovely to work with, and diligent in
        her work. The quality and content were actually a little scary - a very
        early introduction to the standards of some Nomensans! She even took the
        time to actively gather feedback on how she could improve any future
        potential handovers to me - to which I couldn’t say much. I felt fully
        equipped and supported to get cracking with the ECC project in no small
        part due to Robyn’s efforts.

        Robyn is a great practitioner with bags of energy and is extremely
        competent in my opinion. She was great at communicating with others,
        both internally and externally, making really good relationships and
        fostering trust with the project team. She completed some great research
        within a very short window of opportunity, delivering research findings
        in an easy to digest and professional way. I hope to work with her again
        sometime as I really enjoyed her energy, process, and positive attitude.

        Robyn is great to work with - I loved her enthusiasm! She always made
        sure to keep the user in mind in all scenarios, right from the start of
        unpicking research, to the user research sessions she held for
        Essex.gov. She was always an advocate for the users and made sure that
        the feedback from her research wasn’t forgotten and pushed for it to be
        accounted for in the development work. She made sure that the site was
        well prepared for user research sessions too. Robyn was super on top of
        keeping me in the loop, flagging any risks or blockers which was super
        appreciated as it meant the project ran a lot more smoothly. On top of
        that, the client LOVED her! I can’t wait to work with Robyn again in the
        future.

        Robyn has been working with us on the Attack Tree Project to help us
        define changes and enhancements to our web-based RPS digital service.
        This has been done over a series of Microsoft Teams calls rather than
        what might previously have been done in an office based workshop
        environment. Robyn’s engaging approach and quick thinking has really
        helped us get the most out of these sessions. Sketching screen layouts
        and flows on demand, holding them up to camera for workshop participants
        to see / review in real-time is no mean feat and this along with
        subsequent Miro board has enabled us to get to a new prototype of the
        service built quickly. I look forward to her working further on the
        project as she has been a truly valuable team member.

        Robyn helped me loads with my note-taking during research sessions. She
        gave me some really good feedback and helped me completely rethink how I
        go into projects in the future and how I can help myself later in
        analysis. I am so impressed with how well she facilitated the interviews
        and how much information she can take in, record, and synthesize on the
        spot whilst facilitating too - I can’t wait to keep learning! Thank you,
        Robyn

        What shone through most to me is that Robyn really cares about doing a
        good job - she really cares about delivering high-quality thinking, UX,
        and design recommendations. She can dissect a problem in a lot of detail
        in order to make really considered UX decisions and this was really
        valuable when we were mapping out user journeys, flows, and processes -
        this is something we as an agency should really be taking advantage of
        as it's a huge weapon in our arsenal. She also has a natural authority
        which can come across really well in client presentations and instills a
        lot of trust from clients. Robyn also has good wireframing skills and I
        really enjoyed our chats in between meetings too which was lovely!

        Robyn was great on ECC and I hope to work with her again soon. She did a
        great job managing UX research in an unusual situation; it wasn’t very
        clear what questions we needed to answer here, but Robyn’s guidance
        really helped us narrow that down to useful information for the client.
        Her communications on the project were excellent, she kept everyone up
        to date on what was going on, making it really easy to represent her
        work and value to the end customer and to plan dependencies for her
        work.

        Robyn was parachuted in to the project for a mere 8 hours to help out
        with some UX expert review of some key pages, mock up some designs, and
        provide recommendations. To say that she was thrown in the deep end is a
        bit of an understatement as the project was nearing the end. I was
        impressed by her proactive approach, as she was immediately trying to
        find and speak with stakeholders to inform her recommendations from a
        business perspective whilst balancing UX best practice.</p>
        
        <p>I was even more impressed at how quickly she was able to digest the information, do the
        work, and wrap it all up into a very clear and neat deck. Thank you for
        your hard work, Robyn, it was a joyful 8 hours of having you on the
        project with me!</p>

        I first encountered Robyn working on the Attack Tree project for the
        Insolvency Service. At that point the project was struggling somewhat.
        The team wasn't properly engaged with the client, or so the client
        perceived, and there was some doubt about whether the project was going
        in the right direction. This culminated in a crisis meeting in
        Birmingham where Nomensa were to update on progress and sell their
        vision of the project.</p>
        
        <p>As we worked through the various page flows,
        Robyn sketched out the proposed design changes with a pad and a marker
        pen in real time. Sitting in the room with them, I cannot emphasize
        strongly enough the effect this had on the client. From being grouchy
        and dubious about the merits of the whole exercise, they became
        increasingly engaged. Over the course of a couple of hours we managed to
        map out all of the interactions to their satisfaction.</p>
        
        <p>Robyn continued to refine her designs on paper remotely in conjunction with the client
        to the satisfaction of all concerned. Although a wireframe has now been
        created, Robyn’s paper designs formed the basis of the early development
        work of the project, as evidenced by the project Miro board (which
        itself is an appealing blend of analogue and digital).</p>

        Really great start to a Nomensa career, thrown in the deep end with an
        ambiguous brief and a top-tier client, jumped in and delivered solid
        input and work. Really cool to see a dev experience and programmatic
        thinking factored into her UX style, a cool extra asset to enrich the
        solution - she’s very T shaped.

        Robyn's passion for collaboration and truly user-focused design is
        inspiring. Her willingness to work in the open and seek and adapt to
        feedback is exactly what I hope for from a teammate. As a product
        manager, I've found Robyn's design research and analysis to not only be
        insightful, but also thorough, well-presented, and evidences her care
        for considering customer needs and various contexts. The designs Robyn
        has produced for us have been clean and consistent, and I can trust that
        they come with intentional accessibility baked-in from the start.
        Robyn's design documentation is also excellent, so much so that I reuse
        it verbatim for our user guidance! Beyond this, Robyn is also friendly,
        open, kind, and brings a refreshing, positive energy to the team.

        I had the pleasure of working closely with Robyn as soon as she joined
        Nomensa! During her first weeks of onboarding, we had the chance to work
        closely together for 2 days on the UWE-040 project. As a new member of
        the team, Robyn showed a genuine curiosity and a deep motivation in
        actively engaging with the tasks that we were working on. I was very
        lucky to receive her help in the research analysis process, and she was
        able to work collaboratively, and she was not hesitant in expressing her
        ideas and opinions in a nice way, which is a terrific attitude to have!
        By looking at the analysis together, I definitely think she enriched the
        insights and gave me the chance to share and observe different ways of
        working. She is very open and transparent in her collaboration and will
        be great at working with the team. I was very happy to have worked with
        her and I am looking forward to doing so again in the future!

        Robyn was thrown in at the deep end with a fast paced high profile
        project and went at it with enthusiasm and positivity. We worked closely
        together for several months and I found Robyn to be kind, friendly and a
        nice colleague to work with. Along the way we’ve got some great feedback
        from the client. When we visited them in Limerick the client
        specifically mentioned Robyn by name to give credit to her ideas even
        though she was not in the room. I thought that was a great sign that her
        work had made an impact! </p>
        
        <p>Below I’ve pulled out a few areas that I think are particular strong points</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Excels at getting into the small detail.
        Give her a feature or a piece of functionality to explore and she’ll
        think about all the scenarios and edge cases of that feature (for
        example mapping out all the required error states of the Virgin Media
        Ireland serviceability check component).</li>
        <li>Great at getting involved in collaborative discussions, engaged and not afraid to challenge ideas and
        offer opinions which some people find difficult. Had some great ideas to
        put forward herself, and found a passion for the project and championing
        the end users (all three Nomensa values there).</li>
        <li>On multiple occasions Robyn presented work in progress to the clients, she was confident and
        did a good job talking through the work she’d been producing, and the
        rationale behind it.</li>
        <li>Keen attitude towards learning and improving</li>
        </ul>

        Robyn was quite heavily involved during some of the early stages of our
        Intranet work – particularly helping us to get an agreed MVP definition.
        I felt that was a difficult exercise and my view is that Robyn was a
        great help in providing a good level of constructive challenge in the
        initial stages and in helping us with the
        organization/gathering/synthesis of findings and overall approach to
        this. </p>

        <p>The other things that spring to mind are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the work she did to
        consolidate our Intranet Beta Overview on Miro for onboarding. This was
        really helpful/valuable to me, and a good lesson for me/us around better
        organization of stuff in Miro going forward. I feel that’s a great
        legacy.</li>
        <li>Some really good constructive discussions we had around how
        we work together as One Team etc. Again I really appreciated that
        support.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>My impression is that Robyn is very knowledgeable and highly
        competent in her specialism. She has been great at clearly communicating
        her views, ideas, and findings, and is prepared to speak out if she felt
        we weren’t taking a sound user-centered approach for example. She is
        good at tackling some difficult conversations in a constructive,
        professional, friendly, and approachable way. She has definitely been an
        asset to the team!</p>
