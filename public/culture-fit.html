    <h1>Culture Fit</h1>
    <p>I am a great fit for teams who:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>are high performing</li>
      <li>value radical candor</li>
      <li>are strategic and evidence-based and pragmatic</li>
      <li>care about ethics and results</li>
      <li>value impact over form</li>
      <li>trust and empower teammates</li>
      <li>value letting people be themselves; accept differences</li>
      <li>
        practice a culture of personal accountability, direct feedback,
        learning, and growth
      </li>
      <li>are flexible and welcome out of the box thinking and challenge</li>
      <li>
        are UX mature, with clear processes and procedures, estbalished ways of
        working, and a delivery focus
      </li>
      <li>have an open and transparent culture; eg: servant leadership</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A great example of this is my current employer, Hippo. All employees take
      a personality assessment after being hired, which we share with our
      teammates with the aim of fostering better collaboration and understanding
      with each other. The aim of this assessment is simply to help us
      understand each other better, identify our potential blidnspots which may
      impact working together, and to help us respect and work out our
      differences.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also practice a culture of direct and timely feedback. The more
      challenging the feedback, the more important it is to give it and in a
      clear way. Everyone is expected to perform and grow and I am constantly
      surrounded by talent that I can learn from, which makes every project a
      growth opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am supported and encouraged to offer challenge and to follow best
      practice. If a project is not feasible to do within best practice, or if a
      project starts to veer into unethical territory, I am empowered to down
      tools until the project can be brought back on track. We are laser focused
      on results and impact, and understand that project challenges are not
      personal. We are trusted to be able to stick up for the project and to
      handle challenges to our approach without taking it personal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, if a process isn't working well or could be improved, Hippo takes
      the feedback on board and improves it. Innovatation and bold thinking are
      encouraged and open challenge is welcomed and encouraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of this means that we are empowered to do our best work, and to trust
      our teammates to be able to do theirs too.
    </p>
    <p>If this sounds like your team, I would love to hear from you.</p>
